/* Implements an emulation of the stat system call on the filesystem 
   of size fssize pointed to by fsptr. 
   
   If path can be followed and describes a file or directory 
   that exists and is accessable, the access information is 
   put into stbuf. 

   On success, 0 is returned. On failure, -1 is returned and 
   the appropriate error code is put into *errnoptr.

   man 2 stat documents all possible error codes and gives more detail
   on what fields of stbuf need to be filled in. Essentially, only the
   following fields need to be supported:

   st_uid      the value passed in argument
   st_gid      the value passed in argument
   st_mode     (as fixed values S_IFDIR | 0755 for directories,
                                S_IFREG | 0755 for files)
   st_nlink    (as many as there are subdirectories (not files) for directories
                (including . and ..),
                1 for files)
   st_size     (supported only for files, where it is the real file size)
   st_atim
   st_mtim

/* Implements an emulation of the readdir system call on the filesystem

   If path can be followed and describes a directory that exists and
   is accessable, the names of the subdirectories and files 
   contained in that directory are output into *namesptr. The . and ..
   directories must not be included in that listing.

   If it needs to output file and subdirectory names, the function
   starts by allocating (with calloc) an array of pointers to
   characters of the right size (n entries for n names). Sets
   *namesptr to that pointer. It then goes over all entries
   in that array and allocates, for each of them an array of
   characters of the right size (to hold the i-th name, together 
   with the appropriate '\0' terminator). It puts the pointer
   into that i-th array entry and fills the allocated array
   of characters with the appropriate name. The calling function
   will call free on each of the entries of *namesptr and 
   on *namesptr.

   The function returns the number of names that have been 
   put into namesptr. 

   If no name needs to be reported because the directory does
   not contain any file or subdirectory besides . and .., 0 is 
   returned and no allocation takes place.

   On failure, -1 is returned and the *errnoptr is set to 
   the appropriate error code. 

   The error codes are documented in man 2 readdir.

   In the case memory allocation with malloc/calloc fails, failure is
   indicated by returning -1 and setting *errnoptr to EINVAL.
